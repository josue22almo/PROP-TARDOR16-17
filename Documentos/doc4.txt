Wendy Cope

Studying poetry in high school actually ruined poetry for me for years. The focus on rhythm and meter 
took the beauty away. Last week I was introduced to poetry through the lens of preaching. It certainly 
has been ruminating inside of me since then. I can't seem to get this poem of Wendy Cope's off my mind. 
So, I will share it with you.

Names - Wendy Cope 

She was eliza for a few weeks 
When she was a baby - 
Eliza Lily. Soon it changed to Lil. 

Later she was Miss Steward in the baker's shop 
And then 'my love', 'my darling', Mother. 

Widowed at thirty, she went back to work 
As Mrs Hand. Her daughter grew up, 
Married and gave birth. 

Now she was Nanna. 'Everybody 
Calls me nanna,' she would say to visitors. 
And so they did - friends, tradesmen, the doctor. 

In the geriatric ward 
They used the patients' Christian names. 
'Lil,' we said, 'or Nanna,' 
But it wasn't in her file 
And for those last bewildered weeks 
She was Eliza once again.

Dior at Blenheim

Growing up and living my whole like in the heart of London can be overwhelming. This is why it’s important to retreat to the countryside, absorb some much-needed fresh air and escape to the peaceful greenery. Thankfully, I spent most of my university years living in Surrey, but now, back in the city and crying out for that ‘British Countryside Weekend Escape’ I spent the day over the weekend at Blenheim Palace.
A little history lesson…
Blenheim Palace is over 300 years old; it’s a monumental country estate in Oxfordshire and the principle residence of the Dukes of Marlborough. The building of the Palace was originally intended to be a reward to John Churchill, 1St Duke of Marlborough, from a grateful nation for his military triumphs against the French and Bavarians during the War of the Spanish Succession, culminating in the 1704 Battle of Blenheim.
The English-Baroque palace has had generations of Dukes and Duchesses gracing its grand hallways as well as being the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill.

Considering selling my collection

Dear all, as the years have gone by I have realized that I may not come back to my interest in fashion 
photography. Therefore I am now considering selling my collection of about 2,000 magazines ranging from 
the 50s to the 00s. Drop a line if you are interested in purchasing. The magazines are located in 
Stockholm, Sweden and a specification of exactly which issues I have is available upon request.
